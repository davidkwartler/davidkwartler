# Hey, I'm David

I build products that bridge the gap between trust, security, and user experience. My focus is on designing the authorization frameworks that allow platforms to safely partner and scale with the next frontier of AI interaction models.

**What I work on**

- **AI Authorization** — Building identity and consent layers for MCP-based product integrations and agentic experiences
- **Identity Connectivity** — Designing OAuth 2.0 and OIDC systems that power enterprise partnerships and secure data exchange at scale
- **Platform Trust** — Driving initiatives across authentication, fraud prevention, and privacy to improve conversion and account security

**About me**

Senior Product Manager at Expedia Group in Austin, TX. Outside of work, you'll find me at the track in my Porsche, biking Town Lake, or at a concert somewhere.
